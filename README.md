# EasyInventoryAPI v1.0
This project was coded in Minecraft version 1.13.

The purpose of this API is for you to copy and paste the InventoryBase.class into your project(s) to utilize its methods.
This repository does not show you how to register events or how to open the inventory for the player. Therfore, looking at
the Core.class is pointless as it contains nothing within it. The ExampleInventory.class shows you how to create a class and
inventory utilizing the methods.

All the code has been tested and works properly.

Please do not forget to add "api-version: 1.13" to your plugin.yml. The code should still work but you will recieve errors
in the console and some items might not work if you forget this.
